Only Nominatim is boxing New York county (Manhattan) correctly, however, the location coordinates now point to a place on East 86th Street between Madison and Fifth avenues. GoogleV3 and ArcGis use the box of New York City (previous slide).<br>
The newer data shows that AzureMaps has moved to a location called North Castle in Armonk, New York.
