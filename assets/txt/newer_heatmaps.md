There is consistency in the changes! AzureMaps results are still the most differing and for the same boroughs, but the distance differences have worsen by ~500% (the maps will show why).<br>
**Note:**<br>
The heatmap colors reflect the new extremes, some old values may now be greyed out even though they have not changed (e.g. ArcGis/Boston).
