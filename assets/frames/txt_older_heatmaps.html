    <p>The heatmaps on this and the next slide visualize the distance difference of the location coordinates (first matrix), and those of the NE and SW corners of the bounding boxes returned for each of the gecoding queries whose shortened strings are listed on the x-axis.<br>
These differences include a threshold of about 3 miles (5 km), which represents my expectation of the difference magnitude as I was not expecting the results to be identical (geocoding is not an exact science).<br>
As the reddish colors indicate, AzureMaps results differ the most for Booklyn (Kings county) and Staten Island (Richmond county); also, ArcGis and AzureMaps boxes extend to the North East more than the others.</p>
