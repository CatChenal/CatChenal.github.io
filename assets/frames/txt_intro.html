    <h2>Comparison of Four Geocoders: Nominatim, GoogleV3, ArcGis and AzureMaps</h2>
<h3>Geocoding services (via Geopy):</h3>
<p>Geocoding refers to the maping of an address to its geographic coordinates. Specifically, the geocoding of a location specified by a query string can be achieved using calls to geocoding services (APIs) directly in a browser address box, or with a wrapping library such as <a href="https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Geopy</a>.</p>
<h3>Why I setup this comparison:</h3>
<p>In another application, I tried using the New York City boroughs bounding boxes to impute missing borough names for records with geolocation information (via set operations) as a way to prevent over 85,000 requests. I trashed the box 'solution' once I found out about the official territorial boundaries (shapefiles). Yet, in the intervening time I had checked several services for speed and limits and I found that some geocoders were not returning the same geolocation or bounding boxes for the same query, so I investigated!</p>
<p>To date, April 2019, Geopy has 21 traditional geocoders (excluding What3Words), so I picked only four of them. Following are the links to the geocoders documentation and their respective service providers via Geopy:

    </li>
</ul></p>
<h3>Shapefile sources:</h3>
<p>I used two shapefiles: that of New York City (with water extent), and that of Boston, without water extent as it was the only one I found.<br>
<em> New York City: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries-Water-Areas-Included-/tv64-9x69<br>
</em> Boston: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/city-of-boston-boundary2<br></p>
<h3>Places queried:</h3>
<ul>
<li>"New York City, NY, USA"<br></li>
<li>"Cleopatra's needle, Central Park, New York, NY, USA"<br></li>
<li>"Bronx county, NY, USA"<br></li>
<li>"Kings county, NY, USA"<br></li>
<li>"New York county, NY, USA"<br></li>
<li>"Queens county, NY, USA"<br></li>
<li>"Richmond county, NY, USA"<br></li>
<li>"Boston, MA, USA"<br></li>
</ul>
<h3>Report on temporal differences:</h3>
<p>Because I noticed that the results from this April were different from those from last September (2018), I put together an HTML report highlighting the differences.  A persistent oddity is that half of the geocoders tested cannot distinguish between "New York City" and "New York county" (Manhattan): GoogleV3 and ArcGis return identical bounding boxes.</p>

<h3>The main conclusions from this comparison:</h3>
<p><strong>Which is the best of these four?</strong><br />
1. <strong>Nominatim</strong>: &#x2B50; of the glorious open-source community that is OpenStreetMap;<br />
2. <strong>GoogleV3</strong>: similar results to Nominatim; requires an account;<br />
3. ArcGis: the least wrong of the worse two<br />
4. AzureMaps: Oh come on! &#128534;</p>
<p><strong>No hedging!</strong><br />
I presume that it is very unlikely that an application would use different geolocating services, but in the case some 'hedging' is involved (e.g. on limits, time-outs), the geolocation for the same query will be different.</p>
<p><strong>Mind the box!</strong><br />
Additionally, my non-exhaustive comparison of four Geopy geocoders (out of 21), reveals that the boxing of a location is not always principled. For instance, Nominatim and GoogleV3 most often use the shapefile with water extent for boxing, whereas ArcGis and AzureMaps do not; moreover, ArcGis boxes typically extend further North than warranted by the existing shapefiles by at most 10 miles.    </p>
<h4>Final notes on accuracy in the geolocation context:</h4>
<p>I found this <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/8650/measuring-accuracy-of-latitude-and-longitude">excellent resource</a> on precision for geolocations. Here are the main points:  </p>
